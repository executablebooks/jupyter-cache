# Jupyter Cache

A defined interface for working with a cache of jupyter notebooks.

This packages provides a clear [API](use/api) and [CLI](use/cli) for staging, executing and cacheing
Jupyter Notebooks. Although there are certainly other use cases,
the principle use case this was written for is generating books / websites,
created from multiple notebooks (and other text documents),
during which it is desired that notebooks can be *auto-executed* **only**
if the notebook had been modified in a way that may alter its code cell outputs.

Some desired requirements (not yet all implemented):

- A clear and robust API
- The cache is persistent on disk
- Notebook comparisons separate out "edits to content" from "edits to code cells".
  Cell rearranges and code cell changes should require a re-execution.
  Text content changes should not.
- Allow parallel access to notebooks (for execution)
- Store execution statistics/reports.
- Store external assets: Notebooks being executed often require external assets: importing scripts/data/etc. These are prepared by the users.
- Store execution artifacts: created during execution
- A transparent and robust cache invalidation: imagine the user updating an external dependency or a Python module, or checking out a different git branch.
